## Finale üèÅ

For the next few weeks, we will be working on the final project! On week one, I will explain the project and what you need to know in order to do it. Also, I will assign your groups! Let's do this.

## Getting Started‚Ñ¢

1. In JupyterLab, open a Launcher and select `Terminal`
4. Type in `cd CMPINF0010`
    - Or, **if you named your class folder something different**, replace `CMPINF0010` with whatever you named your folder
5. Now, copy and paste this command into the terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/final-project.git
    ```
    - If you can't seem to paste anything, try using Ctrl+Shift+V (or Command+Shift+V)
6. You should see a new folder named `final-project` inside your class folder

### If JupyterLab _still_ doesn't work for you

Use Binder:

_**Important**:_ Binder does **not** always save your work. If you need to stop working on your lab for more than 30 minutes, you need to **download** your exercises notebook to your computer. Then, you can reupload it again later to continue your work.
